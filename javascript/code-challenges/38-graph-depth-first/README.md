# Graph Breadth First

## Challenge Details

## Whiteboard

## What are Graphs?

- a data structure that holds nodes a.k.a. vertices
- all other data structures fit into this category.


## Terminology
- Direction: When an edge points from one vertex to another (uni-directional, biderectional)
- Node/Vertex: an object or "container" that holds the "value" or values
- Edge: connection between vertices. How many eges does a node have? (0 - as many vertexes as exist)
- Degree: How many edges a vertex has.
- A-cyclical: doex NOT loop via edges
- Cyclical: DOES loop via edges. a.k.a. can hot the same vertex more than once while traversing
- Neighbors: vertex connected by a single edge. One edge awaye. No more than one. Can have many neighbors.
