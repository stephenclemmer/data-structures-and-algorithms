# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

### Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

### Stack
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated. This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created. The class should contain the following methods:

**push**
- Arguments: value
- adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.

**pop**
- Arguments: none
- Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
- Removes the node from the top of the stack
- Should raise exception when called on empty stack

**peek**
- Arguments: none
- Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
- Should raise exception when called on empty

**stack is empty**
- Arguments: none
- Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

### Queue
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated. This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
The class should contain the following methods:

**enqueue**
- Arguments: value
- adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.

**dequeue**
- Arguments: none
- Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
- Removes the node from the front of the queue
- Should raise exception when called on empty queue

**peek**
- Arguments: none
- Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
- Should raise exception when called on empty stack

**is empty**
- Arguments: none
- Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

***You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.***

## Approach & Efficiency
Node: O1

**Stack:**
stack O1
push O1
pop O1
peek O1
isEmpty: O1

**Queue**
queue O1
enqueue O1
dequeue O1
peek O1
isEmpty: O1


## API
I do not understand what this question is driving at. I will seek clarification from instructor.
